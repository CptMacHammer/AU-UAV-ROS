Auburn University UAV ROS project

This project is intended to create an environment for both simulation and testing of collision avoidance algorithms on UAVs.

Note: You will still need ROS to execute this on any machine along with some knowledge on rosmake and roslaunch

Added:
-places for messages and services
-core C++ files for main executables
-setup many C++ files for editing, basic functionality, and marked with TODOs
	*collisionAvoidance.cpp
	*coordinator.cpp
	*simulator.cpp
	*visualization.cpp
	*XBeeIO.cpp
-setup CMakeLists for building the data passing executables
-setup a launch file for a simulator only launch
